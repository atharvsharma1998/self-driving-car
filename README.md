# Self Driving Car

Self-driving cars are a shared ambition among Google, Tesla, Apple, Uber and Lyft, among other automotive, tech and ridesharing companies. For Uber and Lyft specifically, it's a matter of cutting costs. However, fiscal expediency is not the main benefit of this emerging technology.

Our objective for this project was to design and build an autonomous driving car that is capable of stable traversal through the self made track with automatic control using machine learning.

This project was developed by us in our college as a final year project. It uses raspberry pi for image processing and arduino Uno for the motor control.

## Functions
- Car can navigate between the lanes.
- It can detect the presence of other car in the lane.
- It can detect stop signs and halt.
